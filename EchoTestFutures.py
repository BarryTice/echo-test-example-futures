EchoTestFutures.py - a simple benchmark used to determine how fast SNAP Connect can
communicate with a directly connected bridge. We use this to evaluate different
Python platforms, implementations, and serial drivers.

This example demonstrates one way to maximize throughput without choking the network.

Refer to comments throughout this file, plus the accompanying README.txt.
